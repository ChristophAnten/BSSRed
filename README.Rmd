# BSSRed (Blinded Sample Size Reestimation with Evnt-Driven Data.)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BSSRed is to provide the methods published by T. Friede et al. [@friede2010blinded], which main aspect lies on reestimation procedures 

## Installation

You can install the released version of BSSRed from [GITHUB](https://github.com/ChristophAnten/BSSRed) with:


``` r
library("devtools")
install_git(url="https://github.com/ChristophAnten/BSSRed.git",
            upgrade=FALSE)
library("BSSRed")
```

## Study Exapmle

This is a basic example to evaluate and varify a study plan with event driven data. 

For this example it is assumed, that we have some prior information from other studies on witch we base our assumptions on the hazard and drop out rates.

We assume, that in the control group 30% of our patients have an event after 24 month and 20% of the patients across both group drop out of the study within 24 month. Assuming a 30% reduction of hazard in the control group. 

The recruitment is assumed to start a bit slowly in the beginning with 11 in the control and 22 in the treatment group, rising to 79 in the control and 159 in the treatment group.

```{r example}
library(BSSRed)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
